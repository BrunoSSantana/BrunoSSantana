# Who is BrunoSSantana?

<p style="width:400px">Welcome to my GitHub profile, my name is Bruno Santana. I am 23 years old and currently studying web development, and focused on the front-end area. I am an enthusiast of technology and how it can change people's lives for the better and that is why I am so passionate about this area that I decided to dedicate myself to. At the moment I am looking for a company that, like me, loves what it does and always wants to deliver the best to people and is always in an unrelenting search for its personal and collective development.
